# <a name="project-info"> Association Rules

Association Rules.

Support: Support is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.

Confidence: Confidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true.

Lift: The ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.

Conviction: The ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions.

Leverage: Leverage measures the difference of X and Y appearing together in the data set and what would be expected if X and Y where statistically dependent.
